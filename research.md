# Research

Within researching student portfolios, a study looks at med students who kept a audio diary about their progress during a clerkship area of their schooling. Within the study, the researchers found that students tend to look at portfolios as a profile of information that is being looked at by employers and other assessors, therefore, the information should be valuable to those assessors. This only allows assessors to see a partial image of the student and their portfolio.   

Comparing this to my own goals, it makes me feel like my goals are less on the professional scale because they are vague and don’t provide goals or achievements that are valuable to an assessor. However, my goals are real goals to me and explain me as a whole persona rather than just a possible employee.
